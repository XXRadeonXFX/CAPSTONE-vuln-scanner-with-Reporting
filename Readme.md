### üîé Problem Analysis

1. **Your Slack setup is wrong**
   From the screenshot, you only added the `VulnScannerBot` app.

   * This doesn‚Äôt automatically give you an **Incoming Webhook URL**.
   * Slack **bots** need OAuth tokens (`xoxb-...`) to send messages via Slack API, not webhook URLs.

2. **Our backend `app.py` expects a Webhook**

   ```python
   requests.post(SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, json={"text": message})
   ```

   This only works if you have an **Incoming Webhook URL** (must look like `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX`).

3. **Your `.env` probably has nothing or the wrong token**
   Since no error is shown, I suspect `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is blank or not an actual webhook.

### ‚úÖ Fix ‚Äì Setup Incoming Webhook in Slack

You need to actually **create and enable Incoming Webhooks** in your Slack workspace:

1. Go to üëâ [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)

2. Create a new app ‚Üí "From Scratch" ‚Üí call it `VulnScannerBot`.

3. In the app settings:

   * Navigate to **Incoming Webhooks**
   * Switch **Activate Incoming Webhooks** to **ON**
   * Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**
   * Select your channel (`#all-vulnscannerbot-ws`)
   * Copy the webhook URL (`https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`).

4. Update your `.env` (in root directory) with:

   ```
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX/YYYY/ZZZZ
   ```

5. Restart your backend:

   ```bash
   python3 backend/app.py
   ```

6. Run a test scan:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://172.30.0.123:5000/scan?image=nginx:latest"
   ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Step

If you want to verify it works before integrating:

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
--data '{"text":"Hello from VulnScannerBot üöÄ"}' \
https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX/YYYY/ZZZZ
```

If this works ‚Üí notifications are fine, and the backend will also work.

üëâ So the issue is not with `app.py` ‚Äî it‚Äôs with Slack setup.
Do you want me to **patch `app.py`** so that if `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is empty or invalid, it prints a clear error (like ‚ÄúNo Slack Webhook configured‚Äù)? That way you‚Äôll immediately see what‚Äôs wrong.
