2.	Project Title: Container Image Vulnerability Scanner with Reporting





Problem Statement

With the rise in containerized applications, securing container images is critical to prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production. However, DevOps teams often lack automated tools that integrate seamlessly into their CI/CD pipelines, resulting in manual checks or no checks at all. This project aims to develop an automated vulnerability scanner that scans container images for known vulnerabilities, integrates with CI/CD pipelines, and reports results, ensuring only secure images are deployed.



Project Goals

1. Develop a vulnerability scanner that automatically scans container images before they are pushed to production, based on known vulnerability databases like the CVE database.

2. Integrate the scanner into popular CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to ensure continuous security checks.

3. Generate detailed vulnerability reports and send real-time notifications via Slack or Teams, allowing DevOps teams to take immediate action.

4. Create a user-friendly dashboard that provides a historical view of vulnerabilities detected, resolved, and pending fixes.





 Tools Used

- Programming Languages: Python (for scripting and integrating CVE checks), Bash (for CI/CD pipeline integration)

- Vulnerability Database: CVE database, using tools like Clair or Trivy to scan container images

- Slack API or Microsoft Teams API: For sending alerts and notifications

- CI/CD Integration: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD

- Prometheus and Grafana: For tracking vulnerability trends over time

- Docker: To pull, build, and scan container images







 Project Sprints



Each sprint has a 20-hour workload, organized into specific tasks for incremental progress.







 Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Basic Vulnerability Scanning

- Tasks:

  - Set up the project repository and define the folder structure.

  - Install and configure the Trivy or Clair vulnerability scanner to scan Docker images.

  - Pull a few sample images and perform initial vulnerability scans to understand output and logs.

  - Explore CVE database integration for real-time vulnerability checks.

- Goal: Establish the foundation by setting up a basic image scanning process and verifying scanner output.







 Sprint 2: Integrating Vulnerability Scanning with CI/CD Pipelines

- Tasks:

  - Develop scripts to automate the scanning process for new container images in Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

  - Define criteria for passing/failing builds based on vulnerability severity (e.g., failing if high/critical vulnerabilities are detected).

  - Add environment configurations to control scanning parameters (e.g., CVE level threshold).

  - Test CI/CD integration with sample images.

- Goal: Ensure the vulnerability scanner works as part of the CI/CD pipeline, preventing builds from passing if vulnerabilities are detected.







 Sprint 3: Report Generation and Notification System

- Tasks:

  - Create a report generation module that organizes scan results in a structured format (PDF, HTML, or JSON).

  - Integrate with Slack or Teams API to send scan summaries and alerts to designated channels.

  - Customize alerts for different severity levels (e.g., critical alerts for high-severity vulnerabilities).

  - Implement daily/weekly summary alerts based on scan activity and results.

- Goal: Develop a reporting and notification system that keeps the DevOps team informed of vulnerabilities.







 Sprint 4: Web Dashboard for Historical Vulnerability Tracking

- Tasks:

  - Set up a simple web dashboard using Grafana (or a custom UI) to visualize vulnerability trends over time.

  - Connect the dashboard to Prometheus to collect and display metrics on vulnerabilities found, resolved, and pending.

  - Implement filters for viewing specific images, date ranges, and vulnerability severity.

  - Test and refine the dashboard for usability and responsiveness.

- Goal: Provide a user-friendly dashboard that tracks vulnerability history and allows for trend analysis.







 Sprint 5: Advanced Scanner Customization and Exception Handling

- Tasks:

  - Customize the scanner to skip certain vulnerabilities based on user-defined exceptions (e.g., approved known vulnerabilities).

  - Add functionality for rescanning images after a certain period or when vulnerabilities are patched.

  - Implement retry logic and error handling for CI/CD pipeline integration.

  - Test exception handling and ensure that users can manage and track known vulnerabilities.

- Goal: Make the scanner more flexible, enabling exceptions for approved vulnerabilities and improving error handling.







 Sprint 6: Documentation, Testing, and Final Deployment

- Tasks:

  - Write comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and troubleshooting.

  - Develop a deployment script for easy setup and configuration.

  - Perform extensive testing on different CI/CD systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to ensure compatibility.

  - Gather feedback from beta users and make necessary adjustments.

- Goal: Deliver a production-ready tool with clear documentation, extensive testing, and user feedback integration.
